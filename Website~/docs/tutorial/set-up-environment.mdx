# Set up Environment

Before starting to convert avatars, you need to set up your environment.

## Install Android Build Support

VRChat supports two kinds of platform, PC and Quest.
Quest is built on Android, so you need to create avatars for Android platform.
To create contents for Android, you need to install **Android Build Support** module for Unity.
When you install Unity with VRChat Creator Companion (VCC), usually Android Build Support is also installed.

:::info
The most difference between PC and Quest is the platform (operating system) rather than performance.
Even if your avatar has excellent performance rank and low polygons count on PC, it is not compatible for Quest unless you upload it for Android platform.

1. Open Unity Hub.
2. Select **Installs** item from the side menu.
3. Right-click the Unity version you want to install Android Build Support.
4. Select **Add Modules**.
