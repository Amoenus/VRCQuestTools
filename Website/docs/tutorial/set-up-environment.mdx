# Set up Environment

Before starting to convert avatars, you need to set up your environment.

## Install Android Build Support

VRChat supports two kinds of platform, PC and Android (Quest, PICO, Smartphone).
To create avatars and worlds for Android, you need to install **Android Build Support** module for Unity.
When you install Unity with VRChat Creator Companion (VCC), usually Android Build Support is also installed.

:::info
The most difference between PC and Quest is the platform (operating system) rather than performance.
Even if your avatar has excellent performance rank and low polygons count on PC, it is not compatible for Android unless you upload it for Android platform.
:::

:::warning
If Android Build Support is not installed, you will see `Android Player is Disabled` error message when you try to switch platform and you can't build for Android.
:::

| Android Build Support is installed | Android Build Support is missing |
|---|---|
| ![Android Module](/img/unity_android_ok.png) | ![No Android Module](/img/unity_android_ng.png) |

If you don't have Android Build Support, you can install it from Unity Hub.

1. Open Unity Hub.
2. Select **Installs** item from the side menu.
3. Right-click the Unity version you want to install Android Build Support.
4. Select **Add Modules**.

5. Select **Android Build Support**.
    :::note
    You don't have to select **OpenJDK**. **Android SDK & NDK Tools** is also not required, but it's required in order to do "Build & Test" on Android devices.
