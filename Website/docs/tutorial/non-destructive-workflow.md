# Non-Destructive Conversion

By introducing the Non-Destructive Modular Framework (NDMF) into your project, you can convert avatars during the build process.
You only need to save the avatar before conversion in the scene, and you can also work with other non-destructive tools.

## Installing NDMF

If [Modular Avatar] or [Anatawa12's AvatarOptimizer] is installed in the project, NDMF is already installed.

If you want to install NDMF manually, follow these steps:

1. Add the repository to VCC from the [Modular Avatar] website.
2. In VCC, select the avatar project to which you want to add NDMF.
3. Click the **Manage Project** button.
4. Click the âŠ• button on the **Non-Destructive Modular Framework** row.
5. The latest version of NDMF will be added to the project.

## Avatar Settings

As usual, add the Avatar Converter Settings component to the avatar and configure the conversion settings.

In a non-destructive workflow, you may need to add additional components to make all adjustments during the build.

### Assigning Network IDs

By adding the Network ID Assigner component to the avatar, network IDs are automatically assigned to PhysBones.
The IDs are assigned based on the hash value of the hierarchy path.
So even if objects are added or removed, the same ID is assigned, and that allows PhysBone synchronization between PC and Quest.

At this point, upload the avatar for PC once to reflect the network IDs.

### Deleting Blush Meshes

Configure the deletion of blush shape key meshes.
Here, we use the [AAO Remove Mesh By BlendShape](https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/docs/reference/remove-mesh-by-blendshape/) component of [Anatawa12's AvatarOptimizer] as an example.

Add the Remove Mesh By BlendShape component to the face mesh and turn on the checkbox for the blush shape key you want to delete.

### Deleting Meshes Only for Android Builds

As it is, the blush shape key mesh will be deleted even for PC builds.
Therefore, add the Platform Component Remover and turn off the PC checkbox.
This will remove the Remove Mesh By BlendShape component for PC builds, and the blush shape key mesh will not be deleted.

## Testing the Avatar

Before uploading the avatar, test it on PC.

1. Change the Unity build settings to PC.
2. Open the VRChat SDK control panel and select the avatar to test in the **Builder** tab.
3. Select **Tools** > **VRCQuestTools** > **Show Avatar Builder** from the menu bar.
4. The **VQT Avatar Builder** window will appear.
5. Click the **Build & Test on PC** button.
6. The avatar will be built with Android settings.

The built avatar will appear in the **Others** category of the VRChat avatar list.
Launch VRChat and test the avatar.

## Uploading the Avatar

After testing the avatar on PC, upload it to VRChat.

1. Change the Unity build settings to Android.
2. Open the VRChat SDK control panel and select the avatar to upload in the **Builder** tab.
3. Select **Tools** > **VRCQuestTools** > **Show Avatar Builder** from the menu bar.
