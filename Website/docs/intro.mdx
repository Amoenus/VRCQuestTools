# Introduction

## VRCQuestTools

VRCQuestTools is an Unity editor extension to support uploading VRChat avatars for Android (Meta Quest, PICO).

Android version of VRChat has very strict limitations for avatars compared to PC version.
So you can't upload your PC avatars for Android without any modification.
You can upload your PC avatars for Android with modifications, but it's very complicated.

VRCQuestTools provides a simple way to convert your PC avatars for Android.

- You can make your PC avatar uploadable for Android with a few clicks.
- You can use various tools to manually make your avatar Android compatible.

:::caution
VRoid Studio avatars use a lot of transparent materials, and they are not supported on Android.
VRCQuestTools can't help such avatars, so you need to modify them manually.
