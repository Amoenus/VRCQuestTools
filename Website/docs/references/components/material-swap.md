# Material Swap

:::warning
This component is an experimental feature.
:::

The VQT Material Swap component provides a simple way to swap materials for mobile platforms.

:::info
This component requires Non-Destructive Modular Framework (NDMF).
:::

## Overview

- Allows defining mappings between original materials and their mobile replacements.
- Defined mappings take effect whole of the avatar.
- Only activates material swaps when building for mobile platform

## Usage

Create material mapping pairs by:
- Setting the Original Material (material used on PC)
- Setting the Replacement Material (optimized material for Android)

## Properties

### Material Mappings
List of original -> replacement material pairs.

## Future Development

This is a proof-of-concept implementation. Future versions may break behavior.
